Amazon E-commerce Frontend Clone
This project is a frontend clone of Amazon's e-commerce website, developed as a practice project to improve web development skills. It replicates the look and feel of Amazon‚Äôs homepage, focusing on clean UI design, structured layouts, and interactive elements.

The website is optimized for large screens (laptops and desktops) and uses only HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript, without any external frameworks or libraries. It demonstrates how a modern e-commerce interface can be created from scratch with core web technologies.

üìå Project Overview

A fully functional navigation bar with categories and search functionality (UI only).

Hero banners with sliding animations to mimic Amazon‚Äôs promotional carousels.

Product grids with hover effects for better interactivity.

Footer design with quick links, similar to the original Amazon layout.

This project does not involve backend development or actual data handling, but it is designed to be a strong frontend prototype.
